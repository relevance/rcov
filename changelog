0.8.1.4
=============================
- Fixed problem in gemspec that was including non existant file

Rcov with segfault bug patched
==============================

Many people are having this problem when using rcov and rspec:   
[http://rspec.lighthouseapp.com/projects/5645/tickets/309-fix-for-rcov-segfault-2][rcov-segfault]

Fortunately a good guy wrote a patch:   
[http://tomcopeland.blogs.com/juniordeveloper/2008/08/rcov-crashing-w.html][patch]

And now we have a rcov gem with that patch:

    $ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com (you only have to do this once)  
    $ sudo gem install mergulhao-rcov

Hope this helps someone.
